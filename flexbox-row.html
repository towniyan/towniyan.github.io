			You can set the CSS rule <code>flex-direction: row;</code> in the flexbox container to put all its items in a row.
			<br/>
			Here, you can see all the items arranged inside a single row.
			<br/>
			By default, all flexbox items are arranged and made to fit in a single row. So, using that rule isn't necessary.
