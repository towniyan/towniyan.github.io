Introduction</h3></div><div class="box">Typically you'd like to store integers, strings, characters, floats, etc in a variable. Just like this:<pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code>int a = 5;
string b = "Hello";
char c = 'H';
float d = 3.14;</code></pre><p>But what if you want to store the memory address of an integer, string, float, etc?
That's where pointers come in the scene.</p></div><div><h3>1. What is a pointer?</h3></div><div class="box">A pointer is basically a variable which holds a memory address.</div><div><h3>2a. Creating a pointer [Declaration]</h3></div><div class="box">From the definition, you know that a pointer just holds a the value of a memory address.<p>Before you create a pointer, you need to specify the type of data stored in the memory address. It's required for performing various operations on the contents of the memory address.</p><p>If the memory address of your pointer holds a float, it'll be called a "float pointer."</p><p>In this example, we'll just work with an integer pointer.</p>Example:<pre class="language-cpp"><code>int* a;</code></pre><p>Let's break it down:<ul><li><b>int*</b> 
translates to "integer pointer."</li><li><b>a</b>
is the name of the pointer; you can name it anything you like.</li></ul></p><p>We created an integer pointer named 'a' since we want to store the value of a memory address holding an integer.</p></div><div><h3>2b. Creating a pointer [Initialization]</h3></div><div class="box">In the previous section, we declared a pointer named 'a' but didn't assign any value to it.<p>As you should know by now, the value will be a memory address. Let's create an integer so we can use its memory address:</p><pre class="language-cpp"><code>int age = 21;
</code></pre><p>This is how you grab its memory address:</p><pre class="language-cpp"><code>&age;</code></pre><p><b>&age</b> 
translates to "address of age"</p><p>The ampersand (&) acts as the "address of" operator.</p><p>Alright, great! Let's set the memory address to the pointer we declared in the previous section named "a."</p><pre class="language-cpp"><code>a = &age;</code></pre><p>Congrats! We just created a pointer named "a" whose value is just the memory address of "age."</p></div><div><h3>2c. Creating a pointer [Summary]</h3></div><div class="body">Here's what the overall code may look like:<pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code>int age = 21;
int* a = &age;</code></pre><p>This is all we did so far:<ul><li>Create an integer "age" with value of "21."</li><li>Create a integer pointer</li></ul></p></div><div><h3>3. Accessing contents of memory address</h3></div><div class="box">If we had code like this:<pre class="language-cpp"><code>int age = 21;
int* a = &age;</code></pre><p>'a' holds the memory address of 'age.' In the address, we have the value '21.'</p><p>The code below is how you access memory contents:</p><pre class="language-cpp"><code>cout << *a; // prints 21</code></pre><p>The asterisk (*) here is a "dereference" operator.</p><p>A dereference operator essentially fetches the contents of a memory address.</p><p>In summary, <b>*a</b> 
translates to "memory contents of 'a'" or "dereference of 'a'."</p></div><div><h3>4a. Practical example [Arrays] </h3></div><div class="box">In programming, an array is just like a variable but has multiple values.<p>In memory, the values are stored one after another. The memory address of the first value is kept and other values are accessed relative to the address of the first.</p><p>The code below will create an integer array of 5 elements:</p><pre class="language-cpp"><code>int a[5];</code></pre><p>5 integers will be placed side by side in the memory.</p><p>If you tried evaluating 'a,'' you'll just get the memory address of the first element in the array.</p><pre class="language-cpp"><code>cout << a; // prints address of first element of 'a'</code></pre><p>Here, 'a' is an array and it represents 5 elements.</p><p> Somewhere in the memory we have 5 integers side by side but 'a' is just a variable which holds address of the first integer.</p><p>What do we call a variable which holds a memory address? POINTER!</p><p>Yes, an array is technically a pointer. It's a smart application of the concept of pointers.</p></div><div class="box">Let's create an array of integers called 'a':<pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code>int a[] = {50, 2000, 1234}</code></pre><p>Let's see what happens when you fiddle with 'a':</p><pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code>cout << a; // prints the address of the first element
cout << *a; // prints the first element, 50
cout << *(a + 1); // prints the second element, 2000
cout << *(a + 2); // prints the third element, 1234</code></pre><p>This may help you figure out why the first element of an array always have an index of 0.</p><p>Let's look at the most common way of accessing array elements:</p><pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code>cout << a[0]; // prints the first element, 50
cout << a[1]; // prints the second element, 2000
cout << a[2]; // prints the third element, 1234</code></pre><p>You may be able to guess how it's all designed now.</p></div><div><h3> 4b. Practical example [Accessing variables outside the scope]</h3></div><div class="box">Take a look at this code:<pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code>void increment() {
	age++; // can't access 'age'
}

int main () {
	int age = 21;

	increment();
	
	cout << age; // still 21

	return 0;
}</code></pre><p>You can get the idea:<br>Integer 'age' only exists within the function 'main' and cannot be accessed from outside.</p><p>Variables declared within a function belongs to a function; they live and die with the function.</p><p>In other words, 'age' is in the scope of 'main' and cannot be accessed from outside the scope.</p></div><div class="box">But what if you wanted to break the barrier?<p>Surely, you can pass the variable to 'increment':</p><pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code>void increment(int age) {
	age++;
}

int main () {
	int age = 21;

	increment(age);
	
	cout << age; // but again, it's still 21

	return 0;
}</code></pre><p>Nice try but you still failed to break the barrier of scopes.</p><p>All you did was pass the value of age to 'increment.'</p><p>The code below:</p><pre class="language-cpp"><code>increment(age);</code></pre>is equivalent to<pre class="language-cpp"><code>increment(21);</code></pre><p>No wonder why the function, 'increment' can't alter the variable 'age' which belongs to 'main' in any way.</p></div><div class="box">But wait! What if we passed the address of 'age' to 'increment' like this?<pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code>increment(&age);</code></pre><p>The function 'increment' could be written like this:</p><pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code>void increment(int* age) { // store the memory address in an integer pointer named 'age'
	(*age)++;
}</code></pre><p>The overall code would look something like this:</p><pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code>void increment(int* age) { // store the memory address in an integer pointer named 'age'
	(*age)++; // get the contents of the memory and alter it by adding 1 to it
}

int main () {
	int age = 21;

	increment(&age); // pass value of the memory address of 'age'
	
	cout << age; // prints 21, SOLVED!

	return 0;
}</code></pre><p>There we have it folks! We broke the barrier of scopes via pointers ;)</p></div><div><h3>4c. Practical example [Swapping variables]</h3></div><div class="box">Yeah! Nothing beats the classic example of swapping variables popular in almost every language.<p>You know it, you got two variables and you want to switch their values.</p><p>So if you have 2 integers with values of 5 and 10 respectively, swapping them would mean switching their values and set them 10 and 5 respectively.</p><pre class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code>void swap (int* a, int* b) {
	int c = *a; // now, c = 5, a = 5, b = 10
	*a = *b; // now, a = 10, b = 10, c = 5
	*b = c; // finally, b = 5, a = 10, c = 5
}

int main () {
	int a = 5, b = 10;
	swap(&a, &b);
	return 0;
}</code></pre></div><div><h3>5.
